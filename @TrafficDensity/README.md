# TrafficDensity Class

This directory contains the TrafficDensity class definition. The software utilizes Matlab's built-in documentation generation for custom classes, which will generate documentation based on comments in the code. For documentation for the entire class, including all properties and methods, the user can execute `doc TrafficDensity` from the Matlab command window (presuming that the class is on the current path). The user may also access help for specific methods and properties using a similar syntax&mdash;e.g., `doc TrafficDensity.run` for the run method or `doc TrafficDensity.ownspeed` for the ownspeed property. The documentation can also be accessed using the instantiated object rather than the class.
