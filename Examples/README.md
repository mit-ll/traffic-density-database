# Examples

This directory contains several examples that will aid the user in understanding the software syntax.

The examples are as follows (it is recommended that a new user execute the examples in the order listed):
1. [simpleExample](simpleExample.m): executes software using all default options. Will evaluate entire geographic area extent in the input data, and plot using default options.
2. [simpleExampleLowAltitude](simpleExampleLowAltitude.m): an example of using the low-altitude/finer discretization tables instead of the default tables (all altitudes/coarser discretization).
3. [simpleExampleArea](simpleExampleArea.m): an example of setting a new geographic region of interest.
4. [simpleExampleTrack](simpleExampleTrack.m): an example of setting and processing an aircraft track. This file uses exampleTrack.csv, which is also provided in this directory.
5. [exampleTrackTemporalSelect](exampleTrackTemporalSelect.m): an example of setting specific times of day, months of year, days of week, and aircraft categories.
6. [exampleAreaPlot](exampleAreaPlot.m): an example of setting specific altitude bins, processing noncooperative aircraft, plotting airspace class and coverage information, and plotting with options.
