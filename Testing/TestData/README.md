# TestData

This directory contains data used by the Traffic Density Tool unit tests:

* **cellOrigTest.mat** - basic cell data structure containing one-year of data produced by `generateTestCellData`. This structure is modified by `generateTestData` to generate the various test data sets described below.
* **emptyCellCoverage.mat**, **emptyTest.mat** - used by the `testMissingData` unit test. In this test, every cell has 0% coverage/NaN data.
* **halfEmptyCellCoverage.mat**, **halfEmptyTest.mat** - used by the `testMissingData` unit test. In this test, every other cell has 0% coverage/NaN data.
* **job_test.dat** - contains meta-data associated with the input traffic density information used for testing: in particular, the size and extent of the input traffic density data (spatial and temporal bin definition).
* **testAirspaceA.mat**, **testAirspaceB.mat**, **testAirspaceC.mat**, **testAirspaceD.mat**, **testAirspaceO.mat**, **testAirspaceAll.mat** - airspace data used for testing. In testAirspaceAll.mat, all airspaces (A, B, C, D, O) have 20% coverage. In testAirspaceX.mat, Airspace X has 100% coverage; all other airspaces have 0% coverage.
* **testCellCoverage.mat** - cell coverage data used for testing: every cell has 100% coverage.
* **testData.mat** - simple fabricated data set containing one year's worth of data for 3 altitudes bins: 0-10000 ft, 10000-20000 ft, 20000-30000 ft. Cells in altitude bins 1, 2, 3 were assigned total time/maximum occupancy equal to 1, 2, 3, respectively. Data was NaN elsewhere. Used in `testGenerateDensity` unit test
* **testDataArea.mat** - variation of testData.mat that only contains positive data for latitudes between 48.5° and 49.5°, longitudes between -126.5° and -125.5° (0s elsewhere). Data is densest in the center becoming less dense toward the edges of the region. Used to test position-filtering capability in the `testArea` unit test
* **testDataDay.mat** - variation of testData.mat, where the total time/max occupancy of each cell is equal to the cell's day (e.g., 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.). Used to test time-filtering capability in the `testTemporal` unit test
* **estDataHour.mat** - variation of testData.mat, where the total time/max occupancy of each cell is equal to the cell's hour (e.g., 1 for Hour Bin 1 (Midnight - 3AM), 2 for Hour Bin 2 (3AM - 6AM), etc.). Used to test time-filtering capability in the `testTemporal` unit test
* **testDataMonth.mat** - variation of testData.mat, where the total time/max occupancy of each cell is equal to the cell's month (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.). Used to test time-filtering capability in the `testTemporal` unit test
* **testTrack.csv** - a straight-and-level test trajectory. Used to verify correct calculation of collision risk in the `testTrajectory` unit test
* **volumeMatrix.mat** - matrix containing the volume of each cell. Used to verify correct calculation of metrics in the `testGenerateDensity` and `testTemporal` unit tests
